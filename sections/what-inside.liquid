    The Bakuchiol serum in this formula is designed as a gentle plant-based retinol alternative for anyone
    seeking visible anti-aging results without irritation. This lightweight serum helps soften the look of
    fine lines, uneven texture, and dryness while supporting a smoother, more radiant complexion. The
    peptide complex works alongside Bakuchiol to maintain firmness, while the hydrating lipid blend
    strengthens the moisture barrier for long-lasting plumpness. This combination makes the Bakuchiol
    serum a highly effective, non-irritating option for those wanting a natural retinol-like benefit with
    improved skin comfort and daily usability.
